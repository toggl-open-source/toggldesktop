Toggl Desktop app requires Qt 5.5 to run.
These libraries *are not* packaged with the Toggl Desktop app.

To install Qt, please follow these links:

http://www.qt.io/download-open-source/

After building and installing Qt, you'll need
to add the libraries to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in order for the
Toggl Desktop app to run. You can run add it each time you run the
Toggl Desktop app like this:

	LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH ./TogglDesktop

(Assuming the Qt libraries at /home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib)

Or you can append the libraries permanently like this:

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tanel/poco/lib/Linux/x86_64:/home/tanel/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

(Then just type ./TogglDesktop to run the Toggl Desktop app).

Please note that the Qt libraries may or may not be
available on your distro as a prebuilt package.
Installing the libraries from source is possible on any Linux platform.

Should you experience any problems, please contact the Toggl
Desktop app developers at:

If you're able to run the Toggl Desktop app, then you
can also send feedback directly from the app itself.
In that case, log files are automatically included with
the feedback to resolve the issue faster.
