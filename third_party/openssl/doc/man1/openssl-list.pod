=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command is used to generate list of algorithms or disabled
features.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Display a usage message.

=item B<-verbose>

Displays extra information.
The options below where verbosity applies say a bit more about what that means.

=item B<-1>

List the commands, digest-commands, or cipher-commands in a single column.
If used, this option must be given first.

=item B<-commands>

Display a list of standard commands.

=item B<-digest-commands>

Display a list of message digest commands, which are typically used
as input to the L<openssl-dgst(1)> or L<openssl-speed(1)> commands.

=item B<-cipher-commands>

Display a list of cipher commands, which are typically used as input
to the L<openssl-dgst(1)> or L<openssl-speed(1)> commands.

=item B<-digest-algorithms>, B<-kdf-algorithms>, B<-mac-algorithms>,
B<-cipher-algorithms>

Display a list of cipher, digest, kdf and mac algorithms.
See L</Display of algorithm names> for a description of how names are
displayed.

In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get additional
information on what parameters each implementation supports.

=item B<-random-generators>

Display a list of random number generators.
See L</Display of algorithm names> for a description of how names are
displayed.

=item B<-encoders>

Display a list of encoders.
See L</Display of algorithm names> for a description of how names are
displayed.

In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get additional
information on what parameters each implementation supports.

=item B<-decoders>

Display a list of decoders.
See L</Display of algorithm names> for a description of how names are
displayed.

In verbose mode, the algorithms provided by a provider will get additional
information on what parameters each implementation supports.

=item B<-public-key-algorithms>

Display a list of public key algorithms, with each algorithm as
a block of multiple lines, all but the first are indented.


=item B<-public-key-methods>

This option is deprecated.

Display a list of public key method OIDs.

=item B<-engines>

This option is deprecated.

Display a list of loaded engines.


=item B<-disabled>

Display a list of disabled features, those that were compiled out
of the installation.

=item B<-objects>

Display a list of built in objects, i.e. OIDs with names.  They're listed in the
format described in L<config(5)/ASN1 Object Configuration Module>.

=item B<-options> I<command>

Output a two-column list of the options accepted by the specified I<command>.
The first is the option name, and the second is a one-character indication
of what type of parameter it takes, if any.
This is an internal option, used for checking that the documentation
is complete.

=item B<-provider> I<name>

=item B<-provider-path> I<path>

See L<openssl(1)/Provider Options>.

=head2 Display of algorithm names

Algorithm names may be displayed in one of two manners:

=over 4

=item Legacy implementations

Legacy implementations will simply display the main name of the
algorithm on a line of its own, or in the form C<<foo > bar>> to show
that C<foo> is an alias for the main name, C<bar>

=item Provided implementations

Implementations from a provider are displayed like this if the
implementation is labeled with a single name:

 foo @ bar

or like this if it's labeled with multiple names:

 { foo1, foo2 } @bar

In both cases, C<bar> is the name of the provider.

=back

=head1 HISTORY

The B<-engines> and B<-public-key-methods> options were deprecated in
OpenSSL 3.0.
