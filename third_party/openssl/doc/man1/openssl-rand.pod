=head1 NAME

openssl-rand - generate pseudo-random bytes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<openssl rand>
[B<-help>]
[B<-out> I<file>]
[B<-base64>]
[B<-hex>]
[B<-engine> I<id>]
[B<-rand> I<files>]
[B<-writerand> I<file>]
[B<-provider> I<name>]
[B<-provider-path> I<path>]
I<num>

=for openssl ifdef engine

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command generates I<num> random bytes using a cryptographically
secure pseudo random number generator (CSPRNG).

The random bytes are generated using the L<RAND_bytes(3)> function,
which provides a security level of 256 bits, provided it managed to
seed itself successfully from a trusted operating system entropy source.
Otherwise, the command will fail with a nonzero error code.
For more details, see L<RAND_bytes(3)>, L<RAND(7)>, and L<EVP_RAND(7)>.
