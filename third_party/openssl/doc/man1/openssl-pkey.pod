=head1 DESCRIPTION

This command processes public or private keys. They can be
converted between various forms and their components printed out.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item B<-help>

Print out a usage message.

=item B<-inform> B<DER>|B<PEM>|B<P12>|B<ENGINE>

The key input format; the default is B<PEM>.
The only value with effect is B<ENGINE>; all others have become obsolete.
See L<openssl(1)/Format Options> for details.

=item B<-outform> B<DER>|B<PEM>

The key output formats; the default is B<PEM>.
See L<openssl(1)/Format Options> for details.

=item B<-in> I<filename>

This specifies the input filename to read a key from or standard input if this
option is not specified. If the key is encrypted a pass phrase will be
prompted for.

=item B<-passin> I<arg>, B<-passout> I<arg>

The password source for the input and output file.
For more information about the format of B<arg>
see L<openssl(1)/Pass Phrase Options>.

=item B<-out> I<filename>

This specifies the output filename to write a key to or standard output if this
option is not specified. If any encryption options are set then a pass phrase
will be prompted for. The output filename should B<not> be the same as the input
filename.

=item B<-traditional>

Normally a private key is written using standard format: this is PKCS#8 form
with the appropriate encryption algorithm (if any). If the B<-traditional>
option is specified then the older "traditional" format is used instead.

=item B<-I<cipher>>

These options encrypt the private key with the supplied cipher. Any algorithm
name accepted by EVP_get_cipherbyname() is acceptable such as B<des3>.

=item B<-text>

Prints out the various public or private key components in
plain text in addition to the encoded version.

=item B<-text_pub>

Print out only public key components even if a private key is being processed.

=item B<-noout>

Do not output the encoded version of the key.

=item B<-pubin>

By default a private key is read from the input file: with this
option a public key is read instead.

=item B<-pubout>

By default a private key is output: with this option a public
key will be output instead. This option is automatically set if
the input is a public key.

=item B<-check>

This option checks the consistency of a key pair for both public and private
components.

=item B<-pubcheck>

This option checks the correctness of either a public key or the public component
of a key pair.

=item B<-ec_conv_form> I<arg>

This option only applies to elliptic curve based public and private keys.

This specifies how the points on the elliptic curve are converted
into octet strings. Possible values are: B<compressed> (the default
value), B<uncompressed> and B<hybrid>. For more information regarding
the point conversion forms please read the X9.62 standard.
B<Note> Due to patent issues the B<compressed> option is disabled
by default for binary curves and can be enabled by defining
the preprocessor macro B<OPENSSL_EC_BIN_PT_COMP> at compile time.

=item B<-ec_param_enc> I<arg>

This option only applies to elliptic curve based public and private keys.

This specifies how the elliptic curve parameters are encoded.
Possible value are: B<named_curve>, i.e. the ec parameters are
specified by an OID, or B<explicit> where the ec parameters are
explicitly given (see RFC 3279 for the definition of the
EC parameters structures). The default value is B<named_curve>.
B<Note> the B<implicitlyCA> alternative, as specified in RFC 3279,
is currently not implemented in OpenSSL.

=item B<-engine> I<id>

See L<openssl(1)/Engine Options>.
This option is deprecated.

=item B<-provider> I<name>

=item B<-provider-path> I<path>

See L<openssl(1)/Provider Options>.

=head1 EXAMPLES

To remove the pass phrase on a private key:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -out keyout.pem

To encrypt a private key using triple DES:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -des3 -out keyout.pem

To convert a private key from PEM to DER format:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -outform DER -out keyout.der

To print out the components of a private key to standard output:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -text -noout

To print out the public components of a private key to standard output:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -text_pub -noout

To just output the public part of a private key:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -pubout -out pubkey.pem

To change the EC parameters encoding to B<explicit>:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -ec_param_enc explicit -out keyout.pem

To change the EC point conversion form to B<compressed>:

 openssl pkey -in key.pem -ec_conv_form compressed -out keyout.pem
