=head1 NAME

fips_config - OpenSSL FIPS configuration

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A separate configuration file, using the OpenSSL L<config(5)> syntax,
is used to hold information about the FIPS module. This includes a digest
of the shared library file, and status about the self-testing.
This data is used automatically by the module itself for two
purposes:

=over 4

=item - Run the startup FIPS self-test known answer tests (KATS).

This is done once, at installation time.

=item - Verify the module's checksum.

This is done each time the module is used.

=back

This file is generated by the L<openssl-fipsinstall(1)> program, and
used internally by the FIPS module during its initialization.

The following options are supported. They should all appear in a section
whose name is identified by the B<fips> option in the B<providers>
section, as described in L<config(5)/Provider Configuration Module>.

=over 4

=item B<module-mac>

The calculated MAC of the FIPS provider file.

=item B<install-version>

A version number for the fips install process. Should be 1.

=item B<install-status>

An indicator that the self-tests were run.
This should only be written after the module has
successfully passed its self tests during installation.
If this field is not present, then the self tests will run when the module
loads.

=item B<install-mac>

A MAC of the value of the B<install-status> option, to prevent accidental
changes to that value.
It is written-to at the same time as B<install-status> is updated.

=back

For example:

 [fips_sect]
 install-version = 1
 module-mac = 41:D0:FA:C2:5D:41:75:CD:7D:C3:90:55:6F:A4:DC
 install-mac = FE:10:13:5A:D3:B4:C7:82:1B:1E:17:4C:AC:84:0C
 install-status = INSTALL_SELF_TEST_KATS_RUN
