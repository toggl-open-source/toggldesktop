<p>SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type, SSL_CONF_cmd - send configuration command</p>

<h1 id="SYNOPSIS">SYNOPSIS</h1>

<pre><code> #include &lt;openssl/ssl.h&gt;

 int SSL_CONF_cmd(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option, const char *value);
 int SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type(SSL_CONF_CTX *ctx, const char *option);</code></pre>

<h1 id="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</h1>

<p>The function SSL_CONF_cmd() performs configuration operation <b>option</b> with optional parameter <b>value</b> on <b>ctx</b>. Its purpose is to simplify application configuration of <b>SSL_CTX</b> or <b>SSL</b> structures by providing a common framework for command line options or configuration files.</p>

<p>SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type() returns the type of value that <b>option</b> refers to.</p>

<h1 id="SUPPORTED-COMMAND-LINE-COMMANDS">SUPPORTED COMMAND LINE COMMANDS</h1>

<p>Currently supported <b>option</b> names for command lines (i.e. when the flag <b>SSL_CONF_CMDLINE</b> is set) are listed below. Note: all <b>option</b> names are case sensitive. Unless otherwise stated commands can be used by both clients and servers and the <b>value</b> parameter is not used. The default prefix for command line commands is <b>-</b> and that is reflected below.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="sigalgs-algs"><b>-sigalgs</b> <i>algs</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This sets the supported signature algorithms for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. For clients this value is used directly for the supported signature algorithms extension. For servers it is used to determine which signature algorithms to support.</p>

<p>The <b>algs</b> argument should be a colon separated list of signature algorithms in order of decreasing preference of the form <b>algorithm+hash</b> or <b>signature_scheme</b>. <b>algorithm</b> is one of <b>RSA</b>, <b>DSA</b> or <b>ECDSA</b> and <b>hash</b> is a supported algorithm OID short name such as <b>SHA1</b>, <b>SHA224</b>, <b>SHA256</b>, <b>SHA384</b> of <b>SHA512</b>.

<p>If this option is not set then all signature algorithms supported by the OpenSSL library are permissible.</p>

<p>Note: algorithms which specify a PKCS#1 v1.5 signature scheme (either by using <b>RSA</b> as the <b>algorithm</b> or by using one of the <b>rsa_pkcs1_*</b> identifiers) are ignored in TLSv1.3 and will not be negotiated.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="client_sigalgs-algs"><b>-client_sigalgs</b> <i>algs</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This sets the supported signature algorithms associated with client authentication for TLSv1.2 and TLSv1.3. For servers the <b>algs</b> is used in the <b>signature_algorithms</b> field of a <b>CertificateRequest</b> message. For clients it is used to determine which signature algorithm to use with the client certificate. If a server does not request a certificate this option has no effect.</p>

<p>The syntax of <b>algs</b> is identical to <b>-sigalgs</b>. If not set, then the value set for <b>-sigalgs</b> will be used instead.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="groups-groups"><b>-groups</b> <i>groups</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This sets the supported groups. For clients, the groups are sent using the supported groups extension. For servers, it is used to determine which group to use. This setting affects groups used for signatures (in TLSv1.2 and earlier) and key exchange. The first group listed will also be used for the <b>key_share</b> sent by a client in a TLSv1.3 <b>ClientHello</b>.</p>

<p>The <b>groups</b> argument is a colon separated list of groups. The group can be either the <b>NIST</b> name (e.g. <b>P-256</b>), some other commonly used name where applicable (e.g. <b>X25519</b>, <b>ffdhe2048</b>) or an OpenSSL OID name (e.g. <b>prime256v1</b>). Group names are case sensitive. The list should be in order of preference with the most preferred group first.</p>

<p>Currently supported groups for <b>TLSv1.3</b> are <b>P-256</b>, <b>P-384</b>, <b>P-521</b>, <b>X25519</b>, <b>X448</b>, <b>ffdhe2048</b>, <b>ffdhe3072</b>, <b>ffdhe4096</b>, <b>ffdhe6144</b>, <b>ffdhe8192</b>.</p>

<dd>

<p>This is a synonym for the <b>-groups</b> command.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="named_curve-curve"><b>-named_curve</b> <i>curve</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>This sets the temporary curve used for ephemeral ECDH modes. Only used by servers.</p>

<p>The <b>groups</b> argument is a curve name or the special value <b>auto</b> which picks an appropriate curve based on client and server preferences. The curve can be either the <b>NIST</b> name (e.g. <b>P-256</b>) or an OpenSSL OID name (e.g. <b>prime256v1</b>). Curve names are case sensitive.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="cipher-ciphers"><b>-cipher</b> <i>ciphers</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuite list to <b>ciphers</b>. This list will be combined with any configured TLSv1.3 ciphersuites. Note: syntax checking of <b>ciphers</b> is currently not performed unless a <b>SSL</b> or <b>SSL_CTX</b> structure is associated with <b>ctx</b>.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="ciphersuites-1.3ciphers"><b>-ciphersuites</b> <i>1.3ciphers</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the available ciphersuites for TLSv1.3 to value. This is a colon-separated list of TLSv1.3 ciphersuite names in order of preference. This list will be combined any configured TLSv1.2 and below ciphersuites. See <a href="../man1/openssl-ciphers.html">openssl-ciphers(1)</a> for more information.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="min_protocol-minprot--max_protocol-maxprot"><b>-min_protocol</b> <i>minprot</i>, <b>-max_protocol</b> <i>maxprot</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Sets the minimum and maximum supported protocol. Currently supported protocol values are <b>SSLv3</b>, <b>TLSv1</b>, <b>TLSv1.1</b>, <b>TLSv1.2</b>, <b>TLSv1.3</b> for TLS; <b>DTLSv1</b>, <b>DTLSv1.2</b> for DTLS, and <b>None</b> for no limit. If either the lower or upper bound is not specified then only the other bound applies, if specified. If your application supports both TLS and DTLS you can specify any of these options twice, once with a bound for TLS and again with an appropriate bound for DTLS. To restrict the supported protocol versions use these commands rather than the deprecated alternative commands below.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="record_padding-padding"><b>-record_padding</b> <i>padding</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Attempts to pad TLSv1.3 records so that they are a multiple of <b>padding</b> in length on send. A <b>padding</b> of 0 or 1 turns off padding. Otherwise, the <b>padding</b> must be &gt;1 or &lt;=16384.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="debug_broken_protocol"><b>-debug_broken_protocol</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Ignored.</p>

<p>The following options are accepted by SSL_CONF_cmd(), but are not processed by the OpenSSL commands.</p>

<dl>

<dt id="cert-file"><b>-cert</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Attempts to use <b>file</b> as the certificate for the appropriate context. It currently uses SSL_CTX_use_certificate_chain_file() if an <b>SSL_CTX</b> structure is set or SSL_use_certificate_file() with filetype PEM if an <b>SSL</b> structure is set. This option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="key-file"><b>-key</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Attempts to use <b>file</b> as the private key for the appropriate context. This option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted. Note: if no <b>-key</b> option is set then a private key is not loaded unless the flag <b>SSL_CONF_FLAG_REQUIRE_PRIVATE</b> is set.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="dhparam-file"><b>-dhparam</b> <i>file</i></dt>
<dd>

<p>Attempts to use <b>file</b> as the set of temporary DH parameters for the appropriate context. This option is only supported if certificate operations are permitted.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="no_ssl3--no_tls1--no_tls1_1--no_tls1_2--no_tls1_3"><b>-no_ssl3</b>, <b>-no_tls1</b>, <b>-no_tls1_1</b>, <b>-no_tls1_2</b>, <b>-no_tls1_3</b></dt>
<dd>

</dd>
<dt id="anti_replay--no_anti_replay"><b>-anti_replay</b>, <b>-no_anti_replay</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>Switches replay protection, on or off respectively. With replay protection on, OpenSSL will automatically detect if a session ticket has been used more than once, TLSv1.3 has been negotiated, and early data is enabled on the server. A full handshake is forced if a session ticket is used a second or subsequent time. Anti-Replay is on by default unless overridden by a configuration file and is only used by servers. Anti-replay measures are required for compliance with the TLSv1.3 specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and in such cases the built-in OpenSSL functionality is not required. Switching off anti-replay is equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</b>.</p>

<p><b>AllowNoDHEKEX</b>: In TLSv1.3 allow a non-(ec)dhe based key exchange mode on resumption. This means that there will be no forward secrecy for the resumed session. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_ALLOW_NO_DHE_KEX</b>.</p>

<p><b>MiddleboxCompat</b>: If set then dummy Change Cipher Spec (CCS) messages are sent in TLSv1.3. This has the effect of making TLSv1.3 look more like TLSv1.2 so that middleboxes that do not understand TLSv1.3 will not drop the connection. This option is set by default. A future version of OpenSSL may not set this by default. Equivalent to <b>SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT</b>.</p>

Anti-replay measures are required to comply with the TLSv1.3 specification. Some applications may be able to mitigate the replay risks in other ways and in such cases the built-in OpenSSL functionality is not required. Disabling anti-replay is equivalent to setting <b>SSL_OP_NO_ANTI_REPLAY</b>.</p>

<p><b>ExtendedMasterSecret</b>: use extended master secret extension, enabled by default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET</b>: that is, <b>-ExtendedMasterSecret</b> is the same as setting <b>SSL_OP_NO_EXTENDED_MASTER_SECRET</b>.</p>

<p><b>CANames</b>: use CA names extension, enabled by default. Inverse of <b>SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES</b>: that is, <b>-CANames</b> is the same as setting <b>SSL_OP_DISABLE_TLSEXT_CA_NAMES</b>.</p>

<h1 id="SUPPORTED-COMMAND-TYPES">SUPPORTED COMMAND TYPES</h1>

<p>The function SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type() currently returns one of the following types:</p>

<dl>

<dt id="SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN"><b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The <b>option</b> string is unrecognised, this return value can be use to flag syntax errors.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONF_TYPE_STRING"><b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_STRING</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The value is a string without any specific structure.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE"><b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The value is a filename.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONF_TYPE_DIR"><b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_DIR</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The value is a directory name.</p>

</dd>
<dt id="SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE"><b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE</b></dt>
<dd>

<p>The value string is not used e.g. a command line option which doesn&#39;t take an argument.</p>

</dd>
</dl>

<h1 id="NOTES">NOTES</h1>

<p>The order of operations is significant. This can be used to set either defaults or values which cannot be overridden. For example if an application calls:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Protocol&quot;, &quot;-SSLv3&quot;);
 SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);</code></pre>

<p>it will disable SSLv3 support by default but the user can override it. If however the call sequence is:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, userparam, uservalue);
 SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Protocol&quot;, &quot;-SSLv3&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>SSLv3 is <b>always</b> disabled and attempt to override this by the user are ignored.</p>

<p>By checking the return code of SSL_CONF_cmd() it is possible to query if a given <b>option</b> is recognised, this is useful if SSL_CONF_cmd() values are mixed with additional application specific operations.</p>

<p>For example an application might call SSL_CONF_cmd() and if it returns -2 (unrecognised command) continue with processing of application specific commands.</p>

<p>Applications can also use SSL_CONF_cmd() to process command lines though the utility function SSL_CONF_cmd_argv() is normally used instead. One way to do this is to set the prefix to an appropriate value using SSL_CONF_CTX_set1_prefix(), pass the current argument to <b>option</b> and the following argument to <b>value</b> (which may be NULL).</p>

<p>In this case if the return value is positive then it is used to skip that number of arguments as they have been processed by SSL_CONF_cmd(). If -2 is returned then <b>option</b> is not recognised and application specific arguments can be checked instead. If -3 is returned a required argument is missing and an error is indicated. If 0 is returned some other error occurred and this can be reported back to the user.</p>

<p>The function SSL_CONF_cmd_value_type() can be used by applications to check for the existence of a command or to perform additional syntax checking or translation of the command value. For example if the return value is <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_FILE</b> an application could translate a relative pathname to an absolute pathname.</p>

<h1 id="RETURN-VALUES">RETURN VALUES</h1>

<p>SSL_CONF_cmd() returns 1 if the value of <b>option</b> is recognised and <b>value</b> is <b>NOT</b> used and 2 if both <b>option</b> and <b>value</b> are used. In other words it returns the number of arguments processed. This is useful when processing command lines.</p>

<p>A return value of -2 means <b>option</b> is not recognised.</p>

<p>A return value of -3 means <b>option</b> is recognised and the command requires a value but <b>value</b> is NULL.</p>

<p>A return code of 0 indicates that both <b>option</b> and <b>value</b> are valid but an error occurred attempting to perform the operation: for example due to an error in the syntax of <b>value</b> in this case the error queue may provide additional information.</p>

<h1 id="EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</h1>

<p>Set supported signature algorithms:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;SignatureAlgorithms&quot;, &quot;ECDSA+SHA256:RSA+SHA256:DSA+SHA256&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>There are various ways to select the supported protocols.</p>

<p>This set the minimum protocol version to TLSv1, and so disables SSLv3. This is the recommended way to disable protocols.</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;MinProtocol&quot;, &quot;TLSv1&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>The following also disables SSLv3:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Protocol&quot;, &quot;-SSLv3&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>The following will first enable all protocols, and then disable SSLv3. If no protocol versions were disabled before this has the same effect as &quot;-SSLv3&quot;, but if some versions were disables this will re-enable them before disabling SSLv3.</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Protocol&quot;, &quot;ALL,-SSLv3&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>Only enable TLSv1.2:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;MinProtocol&quot;, &quot;TLSv1.2&quot;);
 SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;MaxProtocol&quot;, &quot;TLSv1.2&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>This also only enables TLSv1.2:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Protocol&quot;, &quot;-ALL,TLSv1.2&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>Disable TLS session tickets:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Options&quot;, &quot;-SessionTicket&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>Enable compression:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Options&quot;, &quot;Compression&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>Set supported curves to P-256, P-384:</p>

<pre><code> SSL_CONF_cmd(ctx, &quot;Curves&quot;, &quot;P-256:P-384&quot;);</code></pre>

<h1 id="HISTORY">HISTORY</h1>

<p>The SSL_CONF_cmd() function was added in OpenSSL 1.0.2.</p>

<p>The <b>SSL_OP_NO_SSL2</b> option doesn&#39;t have effect since 1.1.0, but the macro is retained for backwards compatibility.</p>

<p>The <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_NONE</b> was added in OpenSSL 1.1.0. In earlier versions of OpenSSL passing a command which didn&#39;t take an argument would return <b>SSL_CONF_TYPE_UNKNOWN</b>.</p>

<p><b>MinProtocol</b> and <b>MaxProtocol</b> where added in OpenSSL 1.1.0.</p>

<p><b>AllowNoDHEKEX</b> and <b>PrioritizeChaCha</b> were added in OpenSSL 1.1.1.</p>
