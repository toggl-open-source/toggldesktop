=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/decoder.h>

 typedef struct ossl_decoder_ctx_st OSSL_DECODER_CTX;

 OSSL_DECODER_CTX *OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new(OPENSSL_CTX *libctx);
 const OSSL_PARAM *OSSL_DECODER_settable_ctx_params(OSSL_DECODER *decoder);
 int OSSL_DECODER_CTX_set_params(OSSL_DECODER_CTX *ctx,
                                 const OSSL_PARAM params[]);
 void OSSL_DECODER_CTX_free(OSSL_DECODER_CTX *ctx);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<OSSL_DECODER_CTX> is a context with which B<OSSL_DECODER>
operations are performed.  The context typically holds values, both
internal and supplied by the application, which are useful for the
implementations supplied by providers.

OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new() creates a new empty B<OSSL_DECODER_CTX>.

OSSL_DECODER_settable_ctx_params() returns an L<OSSL_PARAM(3)>
array of parameter descriptors.

OSSL_DECODER_CTX_set_params() attempts to set parameters specified
with an L<OSSL_PARAM(3)> array I<params>.  These parameters are passed
to all decoders that have been added to the I<ctx> so far.
Parameters that an implementation doesn't recognise should be ignored
by it.

OSSL_DECODER_CTX_free() frees the given context I<ctx>.

=head1 RETURN VALUES

OSSL_DECODER_CTX_new() returns a pointer to a
B<OSSL_DECODER_CTX>, or NULL if the context structure couldn't be
allocated.

OSSL_DECODER_settable_ctx_params() returns an L<OSSL_PARAM(3)>
array, or NULL if none is available.

OSSL_DECODER_CTX_set_params() returns 1 if all recognised
parameters were valid, or 0 if one of them was invalid or caused some
other failure in the implementation.
