=head1 NAME

BIO_printf, BIO_vprintf, BIO_snprintf, BIO_vsnprintf
- formatted output to a BIO

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 #include <openssl/bio.h>

 int BIO_printf(BIO *bio, const char *format, ...);
 int BIO_vprintf(BIO *bio, const char *format, va_list args);

 int BIO_snprintf(char *buf, size_t n, const char *format, ...);
 int BIO_vsnprintf(char *buf, size_t n, const char *format, va_list args);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

BIO_printf() is similar to the standard C printf() function, except that
the output is sent to the specified BIO, B<bio>, rather than standard
output.  All common format specifiers are supported.

BIO_vprintf() is similar to the vprintf() function found on many platforms,
the output is sent to the specified BIO, B<bio>, rather than standard
output.  All common format specifiers are supported. The argument
list B<args> is a stdarg argument list.

BIO_snprintf() is for platforms that do not have the common snprintf()
function. It is like sprintf() except that the size parameter, B<n>,
specifies the size of the output buffer.

BIO_vsnprintf() is to BIO_snprintf() as BIO_vprintf() is to BIO_printf().

=head1 RETURN VALUES

All functions return the number of bytes written, or -1 on error.
For BIO_snprintf() and BIO_vsnprintf() this includes when the output
buffer is too small.
