=head1 NAME

EVP_MAC-GMAC - The GMAC EVP_MAC implementation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Support for computing GMAC MACs through the B<EVP_MAC> API.

=head2 Identity

This implementation is identified with this name and properties, to be
used with EVP_MAC_fetch():

=over 4

=item "GMAC", "provider=default" or "provider=fips"

=back

=head2 Supported parameters

The general description of these parameters can be found in
L<EVP_MAC(3)/PARAMETERS>.

The following parameter can be set with EVP_MAC_CTX_set_params():

=over 4

=item "key" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_KEY>) <octet string>

=item "iv" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_IV>) <octet string>

=item "cipher" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_CIPHER>) <UTF8 string>

=item "properties" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_PROPERTIES>) <UTF8 string>

=back

The following parameters can be retrieved with
EVP_MAC_CTX_get_params():

=over 4

=item "size" (B<OSSL_MAC_PARAM_SIZE>) <unsigned integer>

=back

The "size" parameter can also be retrieved with EVP_MAC_size().
The length of the "size" parameter is equal to that of an B<unsigned int>.
