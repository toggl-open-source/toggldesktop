=head1 NAME

OSSL_PROVIDER-default - OpenSSL default provider

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The OpenSSL default provider supplies the majority of OpenSSL's diverse
algorithm implementations.  It also acts as a fallback when no other
provider has been loaded.

=head2 Properties

The implementations in this provider specifically have this property
defined:

=over 4

=item "provider=default"

=back

It may be used in a property query string with fetching functions such as
L<EVP_MD_fetch(3)> or L<EVP_CIPHER_fetch(3)>, as well as with other
functions that take a property query string, such as
L<EVP_PKEY_CTX_new_from_name(3)>.

It isn't mandatory to query for this property, except to make sure to get
implementations of this provider and none other.

Some implementations may define additional properties.  Exact information is
listed below

=head2 Asymmetric Key Encoder

The default provider also includes all of the encoding algorithms
present in the base provider.  Some of these have the property "fips=yes",
to allow them to be used together with the FIPS provider.
