    \title Qt widgets in Win32

    This examples shows how to use the QWinWidget class to use Qt widgets
    inside a native Win32 user interface.

    \quotefromfile winwidget/main.cpp
    \skipto WndProc

    The Window procedure for the native Win32 window implements a message 
    handlers for left and right mouse button clicks.

    \printto WM_RBUTTONUP
    When the left button is clicked a modal message box is opened. The
    QWinWidget class is used to provide a bridge between the Win32 window
    and the QMessageBox, and ensures that the Win32 window is modally
    blocked by the message box.

    \printto WM_KEYDOWN
    When the right button is clicked a modeless message box is opened.
    The QWinWidget class is used again to provide proper placement and
    stacking of the message box. Note that this time both the QWinWidget
    and the QMessageBox are created on the heap using operator new. Since
    the \c WDestructiveClose flag is passed to the QMessageBox constructor
    it is however not necessary to delete either of those objects.

    \printto return 0;
    \printuntil }
    When the Win32 window is closed the application is terminated. Unhandled
    messages are processed by the default window procedure.

    \printto int argc
    The application's entry point function \c wWinMain registers a window
    class and creates a window using the CreateWindow API. Note that the
    UNICODE versions of all Win32 APIs are used.

    \printuntil QApplication
    Before the Qt based user interface can be created a QApplication object
    must exist. The translation of the command line arguments is omitted
    for brevity.

    \printuntil win.move
    The QWinWidget class is once again used as a bridge between the Win32
    window and a Qt widget, QPushButton this time. 
    Since the QWinWidget is a proper QWidget it can be layouted and 
    positioned like any other QWidget.

    \printuntil }
    Finally the Win32 user interface is displayed, and control is passed to
    the QApplication event loop. Since Windows doesn't show child windows
    recoursively the Qt widget has to be shown explicitly.
