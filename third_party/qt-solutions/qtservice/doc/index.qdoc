    	\section1 Description
	
		    	The QtService component is useful for developing Windows
    	    	    	services and Unix daemons.
		

	
			The project provides a QtService template class that can be used to
			implement service applications, and a QtServiceController class
                        to control a service.

			On Windows systems the implementation uses the Service Control
			Manager.

			On Unix systems services are implemented as daemons.
