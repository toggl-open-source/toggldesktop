
 About
-------

WinSparkle is a plug-and-forget software update library for Windows
applications. It is heavily inspired by the Sparkle framework for OS X
written by Andy Matuschak and others, to the point of sharing the same 
updates format (appcasts) and having very similar user interface.

See http://winsparkle.org for more information about WinSparkle.

 Using prebuilt binaries
-------------------------

The easiest way to use WinSparkle is to download the prebuilt WinSparkle.dll
binary. It doesn't have any extra dependencies (not even msvcr*.dll) and is
compatible with all Windows compilers.


 Building from sources
-----------------------

If you prefer to build WinSparkle yourself, you can do so. All 3rd party
dependencies are included in the sources archive available for download, you
don't need to install anything else.

At the moment, projects for Visual C++ 2008, 2010 and 2012 are provided, so
you'll need that (Express edition suffices). In principle, there's nothing in
the code preventing it from being compiled by other compilers.

To compile the library, just open WinSparkle.sln solution and build it.


 Where can I get some examples?
--------------------------------

Download the sources archive and have a look at the examples/ folder.


 Using latest development versions
-----------------------------------

If you want to stay at the bleeding edge and use the latest, not yet released,
version of WinSparkle, you can get its sources from public repository.
WinSparkle uses git and and the sources are hosted on GitHub at
http://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle

WinSparkle uses submodules for some dependencies, so you have to initialize
them after checking the tree out:

$ git clone git://github.com/vslavik/winsparkle.git
$ cd winsparkle
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Then compile WinSparkle as described above; no extra steps are required.
