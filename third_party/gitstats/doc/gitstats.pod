=head1 NAME

gitstats - git history statistics generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<gitstats> [options] <repository dir> <output dir>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<gitstats> is a statistics generator for L<git(1)> repositories. It examines the repository and produces some interesting statistics from the history of it. Currently HTML is the only output format.

=head1 OPTIONS

-c option=value

Override a default configuration value. Defaults can be seen by running B<gitstats> without parameters.

=head2 Values:

=over

=item authors_top

How many top authors to show.

=item commit_begin, commit_end

Specify a commit range to generate statistics from. You can specify only commit_end limit statistics to a certain commit or another branch.

=item linear_linestats

When enabled, the lines of code statistics are collected from linear history.
The downside is that commits of long feature branches appear only at the point
where a merge commit is made.

If disabled (old behaviour), the problem is that if two branches contain the
same changes (for example, removal of same lines), the statistics get skewed.

Defaults to on.

=item max_authors

How many authors to show in the list of authors.

=item max_domains

How many domains to show in domains by commits.

=item max_ext_length

Maximum file extension length.

=item processes

Number of concurrent processes to use when extracting git repository data.

=item project_name

Project name to show on the generated pages. Default is to use basename of the repository directory.

=item style

CSS stylesheet to use.

=head1 FAQ

Q: How do I generate statistics of a non-master branch?

A: Use C<-c commit_end=web> parameter.

Q: I have files in my git repository that I would like to exclude from the statistics, how do I do that?

A: At the moment the only way is to use L<git-filter-branch(1)> to create a temporary repository and generate the statistics from that.

=head1 EXAMPLES

=over

=item Generates statistics from a git repository in C<foo> and outputs the result in a directory C<foo_stats>:

  gitstats foo foo_stats

=item As above, but only analyzes the last 10 commits:

  gitstats -c commit_begin='HEAD~10' foo foo_stats
